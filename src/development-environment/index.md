# Your development environment

## What do you mean by environment?
In software development, the term "environment" typically means a computing environment. That includes all the associated tools that run a program or application. Most software organizations have different types of environments[^environments] that are used for different purposes.

Your development environment includes your computer and all the software that you use to write, run, and test your code.
