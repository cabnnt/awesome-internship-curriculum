# Introduction
Welcome, and congratulations! We're so excited to have you as part of our team and we hope you're just as excited to join, learn, and start contributing.

## Usage
This document provides a rough outline for concepts that are likely to be relevant during your internship. In addition, it provides links to resources for self-guided learning of specific tools, languages, frameworks, and libraries relevant. 

- **Set goals:** Work with your mentor(s) to determine a timeline that works with your schedule.
- **No silly questions:** Asking (and fielding) questions is part of being a good software engineer.
- **No test at the end:** You are decidedly _not_ expected to know everything contained herein on the day you start.

### Caveats
- **Non-comprehensive:** Software is unpredictable and no single document could possibly cover all the tools and problems you will encounter. Its goal is to teach you ["enough to be dangerous"](https://www.learnenough.com/our-philosophy) then point you to self-guided resources to learn more from there.
- **Minimal assumed knowledge:** Since you've made it to your internship, it's likely that you already know _some_ or even _all_ of what is contained in this book. However, to acommodate interns from a variety of backgrounds, this document tries to assume as little as possible about what you already know and get you comfortable enough to learn on your own.
- **Take what's useful:** Feel free to skip sections about topics that you're confident you're already familiar with.

## Contributing
If you (yes, **you**!) have any suggestions, please feel free to open a GitHub Issue and/or make a Pull Request to this repository. See the [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) document for more information on how to do that.
